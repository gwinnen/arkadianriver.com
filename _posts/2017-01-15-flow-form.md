#### Results
Flow form vessels allow the water flowing through them to express sustained rhythmic flow. This is due purely to the shape of the vessel. There is a wide spectrum of potential expressions. Many different designs have been made in order to explore this spectrum, some very elegant and artistically satisfying forms. So the Flow form impulse can be seen from the artistic side as the unfolding of this range of water sculptures embodying the same idea in aesthetically varied ways. In 1975 I studied with John Wilkes, the creator of these forms and, in fact, worked on preparing the mold for the early designs.
